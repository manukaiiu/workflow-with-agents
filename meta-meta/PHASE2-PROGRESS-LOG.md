# Phase 2 Progress Log

## 2025-12-09 - Session 1

**Status**: Complete
**Duration**: ~1 session

### Completed

**Phase 2.1 - Foundation**
- [x] Analyzed feedback from `feedback-and-improvements.md`
- [x] Created implementation plan with 4 phases
- [x] Defined work types: `feat`, `maint`, `bug`
- [x] Updated folder naming to `NNN-TYPE-name` format
- [x] Fixed auto-increment logic with explicit protocol
- [x] Created maintenance-specific templates (5 docs)
- [x] Updated `>>start` to handle work types

**Phase 2.2 - Knowledge System**
- [x] Created `knowledge/COMMANDS.md` template
- [x] Updated `>>start` to save research to knowledge
- [x] Added knowledge checkpoint to `>>wrap`

**Phase 2.3 - Context Continuity**
- [x] Added Context Continuation Checklist to FOR-AGENTS.md
- [x] Created `>>checkpoint` command for pre-compression knowledge capture
- [x] Documented context continuation in FOR-HUMANS.md

**Phase 2.4 - Extended Documents**
- [x] Created `05-ANALYSIS.md` template
- [x] Created `06-PR-MESSAGE.md` template
- [x] Updated FOR-AGENTS.md with extended doc guidance
- [x] Updated document management rules with new max lengths

**Documentation Updates**
- [x] Updated meta/README.md with complete new structure
- [x] Updated meta/FOR-HUMANS.md with all new features
- [x] Updated meta/FOR-AGENTS.md with all new protocols
- [x] Renamed `00-FEATURE-OVERVIEW.md` to `00-OVERVIEW.md`
- [x] Updated `03-PROGRESS-LOG.md` template with Knowledge Updated section

### Key Decisions
- Work folder renamed from `features/` to `work/`
- Maintenance work uses lighter templates with `01-SCOPE.md` instead of requirements
- `>>checkpoint` doesn't end session - work continues after
- Extended docs (05, 06) are optional, guidance provided on when to use

### Notes
- `concept` type deferred to separate, larger effort
- Breaking changes documented in implementation plan
- All four phases completed in single session
