### how to audit

extract from confluence and add as a info for the maintenance workflow. but make it modular, so non chax-projects can work without it.
<- connection point with smooth-project-setup?

### opinion on ticket information structure

Work out which information is best suited for claude to work on an issue. Probably to generate a best practice Ticket Structure. Cover the large variety in effort that is/can be put in creating a ticket (sometimes just a sentence, sometimes a few hours of work). How could the best practice structure look like, if it is capable of growing with a task (should it be totally grow-able, or should there be predefined zoomlevels?). Is there a specific variety of ticket types with according requirements for structured information?
